## Usage

### Starting the application

Once you have loaded a [supported chat application](./index.md#supported-chat-applications), simply click the Cloak extension's button.

### Chatting

Get your friend to perform the same steps you did above. Cloak needs to be set up on both ends of the conversation.

Once the both of you are done, click the 'run' button in the top right of your screen to start the encryption layer.

You will see a seemingly garbled message appear in the chat window. This is normal. It is the setup message that is being sent to your friend.

All future messages however, will appear to you in plain text. However, the server will simply see a bunch of garbled text!

### Session Management

Everytime you close or reload the tab, the encryption layer will be reset. This is to prevent any potential security issues. Next time you open the app, you will have to repeat the process to enable the encryption layer.

### Uninstall

To uninstall Cloak, simply remove the extension.
