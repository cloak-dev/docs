# User Manual

## Introduction

This is the user manual for the [Cloak](./index.md) application, an end-to-end encryption layer on top of any web-based chat application.

## Installation

See the [installation instructions](./index.md#install).

## Usage

### Starting the application

Once you have loaded a [supported chat application](./index.md#supported-chat-applications), simply click the Cloak 'setup' bookmarklet in your browser's bookmarks bar.

### Chatting

Get your friend to perform the same steps you did above. Cloak needs to be set up on both ends of the conversation.

Once the both of you are done, click the 'run' bookmarklet to start the encryption layer.

You will see a seemingly garbled message appear in the chat window. This is normal. It is the setup message that is being sent to your friend.

All future messages however, will appear in plain text. However, the server will simply see a bunch of garbled text!

### Session Management

Everytime you close or reload the tab, the encryption layer will be reset. This is to prevent any potential security issues. Next time you open the app, you will simply have to click the bookmarklets again to start the encryption layer.

### Uninstall

To uninstall Cloak, simply remove the bookmarklets from your browser's bookmarks bar.
